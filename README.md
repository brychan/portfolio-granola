# Granola

This project was created as a portfolio website. You can find the live version [Here](https://moonlit-yeot-82f196.netlify.app).

## Idea

It's just a simple website in which you can create a Granola recipe, see the Nutrition Facts calculated automatically, and get the step-by-step recipe.
The information has been gathered from different websites, and it's in no way acurate.

## Stack

For the app/website I've used React v18 framework and TailwindCSS. I've decided to use Hooks, Functional Components and useReducer as state container due to the simplicity of the project. The backend is mocked as well as a simple JSON object.
